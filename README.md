# IBM_Watson_Assistant
A chatbot that answer questions related the control panel or the Smart Methods company.Also, it can book an appointment to visit the company's  headquarters in Makkah.

The charbot was added to the control panel that I designed ([you can find it here](https://github.com/sara-alamoudi/UI-Control-Panel)), this was done simply by codying and pasting the Javascript code before the end of the body tag in the HTML source.
